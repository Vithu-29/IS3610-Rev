It posits that \"agents\" (employees/managers) need constant supervision because they tend to pursue their own interests rather than those of the \"principals\" (owners).<br><br><strong>Reducing Agency Costs with IS:</strong><br>Information Systems (IS) reduce agency costs by lowering the costs of acquiring and analyzing information.<br>1. <strong>Reduced Monitoring Costs:</strong> IS makes it easier and cheaper for managers to oversee and monitor the performance of agents (employees) without adding layers of management.<br>2. <strong>Flattened Organizations:</strong> By reducing the need for middle managers to supervise agents, IS allows firms to grow revenues without a proportional increase in management costs, effectively flattening the organization."

Unlike physical assets which deplete with use, digital knowledge expands.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a digital firm like <strong>Amazon</strong> (or a similar E-tailer).<br>1. <strong>Acquisition:</strong> Every time a customer interacts with the platform, data (knowledge) is captured about preferences and behaviors.<br>2. <strong>Application:</strong> This knowledge is used to improve recommendation algorithms.<br>3. <strong>Exponential Growth:</strong> As more users engage, the recommendation engine becomes smarter, attracting more users, who generate <em>more</em> data. The collective knowledge of the system grows non-linearly, allowing the firm to create new value (e.g., predicting demand) that wouldn't be possible with static, linear knowledge storage."

They also provide tools for customers to embed UPS functions (tracking/cost calculations) into their own business websites, creating a tight integration.<br>3. <strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> By investing heavily ($1 billion/year) in proprietary systems like the <strong>DIAD</strong> and automated tracking, UPS maintains high service levels and low costs that competitors find difficult to match."

                    a: "1. <strong>Bargaining Power of Customers:</strong> UPS <strong>reduces</strong> this by increasing <strong>switching costs</strong>. By allowing customers to embed UPS tracking and calculation functions directly into their own websites, customers become dependent on UPS's technology, making it harder to switch to a competitor.<br>2. <strong>Threat of New Entrants:</strong> UPS <strong>lowers</strong> this threat by creating high <strong>barriers to entry</strong>. The massive investment ($1 billion/year) in IT infrastructure (DIADs, global tracking networks, ORION) makes it extremely difficult for new companies to enter the market and compete on the same level of efficiency.<br>3. <strong>Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:</strong> UPS uses IS to compete on <strong>efficiency and service</strong> rather than just price. Advanced tracking and routing (ORION) allow them to maintain leadership despite stiff competition from FedEx and USPS.<br>4. <strong>Bargaining Power of Suppliers:</strong> UPS uses IS to manage its fleet and fuel consumption (e.g., ORION saving miles). This efficiency reduces dependency on fuel suppliers by optimizing consumption, effectively mitigating supplier power through operational control.<br>5. <strong>Threat of Substitute Products:</strong> IS helps UPS maintain relevance. While digital transmission (email) is a substitute for document delivery, UPS uses its IS to specialize in physical logistics (which cannot be digitized), improving speed and reliability to keep physical shipping viable."

A system that uses IoT sensors to predict engine failures or maintenance needs <em>before</em> a breakdown occurs would further support <strong>Operational Excellence</strong> by preventing delays and reducing emergency repair costs."
