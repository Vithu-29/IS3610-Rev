            title: "Q1: Kroger Co. Case Study",
            context: `Kroger Co. is one of the leading supermarkets in the US. They use "Kroger Value" lines and private labels (manufacturing their own goods). 
      
      Key Facts:
      - 2,477 supermarkets.
      - 42 manufacturing plants (Vertical Integration).
      - Multi-department stores offer 225k products.
      - "Kroger Value" brand replaced FMV to offer low prices.
      - Local retail divisions have power to buy/offer products based on local demographics.
      - Promotional offer: If not satisfied with Kroger brand, replace with national brand for free.`,
            questions: [
                {
                    q: "(a) Activities conducted by Kroger for customer satisfaction? How to enhance customer intimacy?",
                    a: `Current Activities:
1. Private Label Strategy: Offering high-quality alternatives at lower prices (Kroger Value).
2. Localized Merchandising: Local divisions tailor offerings to local demographics/ethnic needs.
3. Satisfaction Guarantee: Free replacement with national brand if unsatisfied.
4. Bilingual Labels: English and Spanish on value products.

Enhancement (CRM):
1. Loyalty Program Analytics: Use data mining on purchase history to offer personalized coupons (e.g., if they buy baby food, offer diapers).
2. Mobile App: Integration for finding items in-store or digital shopping lists.`
                },
                {
                    q: "(b) Best E-commerce business model for Kroger?",
                    a: `Recommended Model: O2O (Online-to-Offline) / Click-and-Collect.
          
Justification:
1. Nature of Goods: Groceries are perishable. Shipping individual ice cream tubs is expensive.
2. Logistics: Kroger already has 2,477 physical stores acting as "warehouses".
3. Customer Behavior: Customers want to save time walking aisles but might not want to pay high delivery fees.
4. Revenue Model: Sales Revenue (selling goods).`

            title: "Q2: UPS Case Study",
            context: `UPS started in 1907. Today it is the world's largest package delivery company. 
      - Spends $1 billion/year on IT.
      - DIAD: Handheld device for drivers (scans, signatures, GPS).
      - ORION: Routing software to optimize delivery paths (saves 1 mile/driver = $50m savings).
      - Smart Labels: Scannable bar-codes with detailed info.
      - Customers can track packages and embed UPS functions in their own sites.`,

                {
                    q: "(a) Describe three (03) strategic business objectives UPS achieves using IS.",
                    a: `1. Operational Excellence: ORION software reduces miles driven, saving fuel and maintenance costs ($50m/year).
2. Customer Intimacy: Tracking tools and "embeddable" widgets allow UPS to integrate deeply into customer business processes, increasing switching costs.
3. Competitive Advantage: The massive investment in proprietary tech (DIAD, Smart Labels) creates a high barrier to entry for competitors and offers superior reliability.`
                },
                {
                    q: "(b) Explain how IS supports different management levels at UPS.",
                    a: `1. Operational Level: Drivers use DIADs daily to view routes, capture signatures, and track package status in real-time.
2. Middle Management: Regional managers use MIS reports to monitor driver efficiency (stops per hour), fuel usage, and on-time delivery rates.
3. Senior Management: Executives use ESS (Dashboards) to analyze long-term trends in global logistics, decide on hub locations, and fleet expansion strategies.`
                },
                {
                    q: "(c) Impact on Porter's Five Forces?",
                    a: `1. Rivalry: High. UPS uses tech to differentiate service quality vs FedEx.
2. Threat of New Entrants: Low. The $1B annual IT spend creates a massive barrier to entry.
3. Buyer Power: Reduced. By embedding UPS tracking into customer websites, switching costs increase (Lock-in effect).
4. Supplier Power: High (Fuel/Planes). UPS uses ORION to optimize fuel usage, mitigating supplier power.
5. Substitutes: Moderate (Email/Digital docs). UPS focuses on physical goods which cannot be digitized.`
                },
                {
                    q: "(d) Suggest an additional IS necessary for UPS.",
                    a: `Proposal: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance System for Fleet.
Reason: UPS has 112,000 vehicles. A system using IoT sensors to predict engine failures before they happen would prevent breakdowns during delivery routes, further enhancing Operational Excellence and reliability.`
